    "<img src=\"static_images/icons/noun-answer-3361020.png\" alt=\">\" style=\"width:25px\"/>  __Answer:__ I started with a pre-trained ResNet-18 model for transfer learning, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. I froze the early layers to retain general feature extraction while unfreezing the last few layers to fine-tune them for my specific dataset. I added a new fully connected layer to match the number of classes. The reduced learning rate and increased weight decay help prevent overfitting, making the model adaptable yet stable for the task. This architecture balances efficiency and flexibility, leveraging learned features while adapting to new data."
